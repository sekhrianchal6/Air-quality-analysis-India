# Air-quality-analysis-India

Air quality index
of India is a standard measure used to indicate
the pollutant (so2, no2, rspm, spm. etc.) levels
over a period. We developed a model to predict
the air quality index based on historical data of
previous years and predicting over a particular
upcoming year as aGradient decent boosted
multivariable regression problem. we improve
the efficiency of the model by applying cost
Estimation for our predictive Problem. Our
model will be capable for successfully predicting
the air quality index of a total county or any state
or any bounded region provided with the
historical data of pollutant concentration. In our
model by implementing the proposed parameter-
reducing formulations, we achieved better
performance than the standard regression models.
our model has 96% accuracy on predicting the
current available dataset on predicting the air
quality index of whole India, also we use AHP
MCDM technique to find of order of preference
by similarity to ideal solution
